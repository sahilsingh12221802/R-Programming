# Data Structure in R- vectors, matrix, arrays, list, dataframes
#vectors - it is a structure that can contain one or more values of
# a single type, such as character, number or integer.
# vectors are used to represent only 1-D data, such as set of digits
#vectors can be implemented in two forms - atomic vectors, list vectors are sequence
# of elements which shares the same data types.
# vectors supports all data types
# elements of vectors are known as components
# length() - no.of elements in a vector
# Atomic vector - single value
# list vectors - using c function more than 1 value


# Atomic vector of type character
print("abc")

# Atomic vector of type complex
print(56+8i)

# Atomic vector of type integer
print(45L)

# Atomic vector of type numeric
print(12345)

# Atomic vector of type logical
print(TRUE)
print(FALSE)



# List vector of type numeric
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# List vector of type character
a <- c('hi', 'hello', 'bye')
